## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Client-Side WebGL 3D Force-Directed Galaxy Visualization
The client application SHALL provide an alternative 3D interactive knowledge graph visualization at `/graph` rendered with WebGL (via Three.js / `3d-force-graph`), executing calculations entirely on the client-side GPU without placing computational or memory load on the backend server.

The 3D visualization SHALL represent architectural entities in an interactive spherical cosmos:
1. **Pillar Hub Nodes:** Rendered as glowing primary celestial bodies with large radii and pillar-specific emissive glow colors.
2. **Topic Nodes:** Rendered as medium planetary spheres color-coded by their parent engineering pillar category.
3. **Book Nodes:** Rendered as textured or emblem-accented spherical bodies orbiting their parent pillar hubs.
4. **Card Nodes:** Rendered as compact glowing spheres color-coded by SM-2 retention status (Learning: amber, Reviewing: blue, Mastered: emerald).
5. **Highlight Nodes:** Rendered as crystalline or accent-colored satellites orbiting source books and topics.
6. **Relational Edges:** Rendered as glowing 3D vector splines or translucent beams linking interconnected nodes across $(x, y, z)$ space.

The 3D visualization SHALL provide 360-degree OrbitControls supporting rotation around arbitrary axes, smooth pan, pinch-zoom, and a camera reset button. The 3D engine SHALL implement distance-based Level-of-Detail (LOD) label culling:
- Text labels for Cards and Highlights SHALL be culled at overview camera distances and SHALL reveal only when the camera zooms close or when the user hovers over/taps the node.
- Pillar Hub and Topic labels SHALL remain visible across standard orbital distances.

To conserve user device battery and eliminate main-thread lag:
- The 3D force simulation SHALL settle node positions within a bounded warmup tick threshold (max 120 ticks) and halt physics calculations.
- The rendering loop SHALL throttle or pause when the camera is static and no animations are active (render-on-demand).
- Clicking any 3D node SHALL smoothly interpolate the camera toward the selected node and open `GraphDetailDrawer.vue`.

#### Scenario: 3D Galaxy visualization initialization
- **WHEN** the user activates 3D Cosmos mode on `/graph`
- **THEN** the application lazily loads the 3D WebGL engine without blocking the initial route transition
- **AND** initializes a 3D force-directed cosmos displaying nodes as glowing spheres in $(x, y, z)$ coordinates
- **AND** the physics simulation settles within 120 ticks without freezing the UI thread.

#### Scenario: 360-degree camera orbital navigation
- **WHEN** the user clicks and drags on the 3D canvas
- **THEN** the camera rotates smoothly around the orbital focus center at 60 FPS
- **AND** zooming with the mouse wheel smoothly scales the camera distance along the line of sight.

#### Scenario: Distance-based Level-of-Detail label culling
- **WHEN** the camera is positioned at a wide galaxy overview distance
- **THEN** text labels for Card and Highlight nodes are culled to prevent visual clutter
- **WHEN** the user zooms in close to a specific cluster or hovers over a node
- **THEN** high-contrast billboard labels for the targeted nodes dynamically appear facing the camera.

#### Scenario: 3D node selection and detail drawer sync
- **WHEN** the user clicks on a 3D node sphere
- **THEN** the camera smoothly animates to center on the selected node
- **AND** `GraphDetailDrawer.vue` opens with complete node details and 1-click action bridges matching the 2D view.

#### Scenario: Render-on-demand battery preservation
- **WHEN** the 3D layout has settled and the user is not actively rotating or zooming the camera
- **THEN** the WebGL frame loop halts active re-renders until interaction resumes, consuming negligible CPU and GPU cycles when idle.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Dimensional Graph Filtering & Live Search
The knowledge graph view SHALL include a floating glassmorphic control bar (`GraphControlBar.vue`) positioned above the canvas, providing real-time client-side filtering across multiple dimensions and engine modes without triggering backend network requests:
1. **Engine Mode Switcher (2D / 3D):** A prominent dual-button toggle allowing the user to seamlessly switch between the **2D Planar Canvas** (Cytoscape.js) and the **3D WebGL Cosmos** (`3d-force-graph` / Three.js). The active mode SHALL persist in `localStorage` under key `techdaily_graph_view_mode`.
2. **Pillar Category Filter:** Filter chips allowing the user to view all nodes or isolate a specific pillar (`All`, `Backend Runtime`, `Data Storage`, `Distributed Systems`, `Frontend Engineering`, `Engineering Craft`).
3. **Node Type Toggles:** Toggle buttons to show or hide specific node types (`Topics`, `Books`, `Flashcards`, `Highlights`).
4. **Mastery Status Filter:** Dropdown or pill selector to filter flashcard nodes by SM-2 status (`All`, `Learning`, `Reviewing`, `Mastered`).
5. **Live Search Input:** Text input that dynamically matches node titles, tags, and summary keywords. Matching nodes SHALL remain fully opaque and highlighted, while non-matching nodes SHALL fade to 15% opacity with edges dimmed in both 2D and 3D modes.
6. **Reset Filters CTA:** A button to immediately reset all filters, search inputs, and node opacities back to the default global view.

#### Scenario: Switching between 2D and 3D view modes
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "3D Cosmos" mode button in `GraphControlBar.vue`
- **THEN** the 2D canvas is smoothly unmounted or hidden
- **AND** the 3D WebGL Galaxy canvas mounts, preserving active category and type filters
- **AND** the choice is stored in `localStorage` so subsequent visits default to the chosen engine.

#### Scenario: Filtering by pillar category
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Data Storage & Persistence" pillar filter chip
- **THEN** all topic, book, card, and highlight nodes associated with other categories are hidden from the canvas
- **AND** the viewport smoothly animates to focus on the Data Storage cluster.

#### Scenario: Filtering by flashcard mastery level
- **WHEN** the user selects "Mastered" in the mastery status filter
- **THEN** card nodes with status `Learning` or `Reviewing` are hidden from the canvas
- **AND** only cards with SM-2 interval $\ge 21$ days (`Mastered`) remain visible alongside their connected topic nodes.

#### Scenario: Live search node focus
- **WHEN** the user types `"MVCC"` into the search input
- **THEN** nodes containing `"MVCC"` in their title, summary, or tags remain fully highlighted with a glowing border
- **AND** all unrelated nodes fade to 15% opacity
- **AND** pressing Enter or clicking a match centers the viewport onto that node at 1.5x zoom.

#### Scenario: Resetting filters
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Reset" button after applying multiple filters
- **THEN** all node type toggles, category chips, mastery filters, and search queries return to default
- **AND** all nodes and edges return to 100% visibility.
