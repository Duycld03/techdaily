## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Backend-Appropriate Weight Precision

The synthesis worker SHALL load the narration model at the weight precision that minimizes synthesis latency on the selected execution backend, rather than the framework's default. On the CPU (WASM) backend it SHALL use full precision (fp32): the framework's default WASM weights are quantized (int8), which run materially slower on this model because ONNX Runtime Web has no fast int8 kernels, so full precision is faster on the CPU path. On the GPU (WebGPU) backend it SHALL use half precision (fp16). If the preferred precision fails to build for a backend, the worker SHALL fall back to full precision without surfacing a narration error. The choice of weight precision SHALL NOT change any user-facing control, the audio cache key `(chunkId, voice, contentHash)`, or the guarantee that a language's model is downloaded once and reused offline; the produced narration SHALL remain intelligible speech in the slice's language.

#### Scenario: CPU path uses full precision for lowest latency
- **WHEN** a user plays narration and synthesis runs on the CPU (WASM) backend
- **THEN** the worker loads full-precision (fp32) weights rather than the framework's default quantized weights, and produces playable narration.

#### Scenario: GPU path uses half precision
- **WHEN** a user plays narration and synthesis runs on the WebGPU backend
- **THEN** the worker loads half-precision (fp16) weights and produces playable narration.

#### Scenario: Full-precision fallback on preferred-build failure
- **WHEN** the preferred precision for the selected backend fails to build
- **THEN** the worker falls back to full-precision weights, completes synthesis, and surfaces no narration error.

#### Scenario: Precision does not alter cache or controls
- **WHEN** narration is synthesized and later replayed
- **THEN** the cached audio is reused under the same `(chunkId, voice, contentHash)` key and no additional or changed playback control appears.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: GPU-Accelerated On-Device Synthesis with CPU Fallback

The reader SHALL run on-device narration synthesis on the GPU when the browser exposes GPU compute to the synthesis worker, and SHALL fall back to CPU execution when GPU compute is unavailable or fails to initialize, so synthesis completes on any supported browser. The choice of execution backend SHALL NOT change the produced audio or any user-facing control. A backend-initialization failure SHALL NOT surface as a narration error while a working fallback exists, and the backend selection SHALL NOT be re-probed or re-failed per sentence within a synthesis run.

When the browser exposes a choice of GPU adapters, the worker SHALL request a high-performance adapter so a discrete GPU is preferred over integrated graphics. The worker SHALL report the resolved execution device to the reader, and the reader SHALL surface a localized indication of the active compute device (GPU or CPU) within the audio control, so a user on a GPU-less browser understands that synthesis is running on the CPU rather than having to infer it from a raw browser console message. This indication SHALL be production-appropriate — applicable to all deployments, not a local-development banner or workaround — and SHALL follow the reader's responsive-typography and `whitespace-nowrap shrink-0` layout invariants in both the English and Vietnamese locales.

#### Scenario: GPU backend used when available
- **WHEN** GPU compute is available to the synthesis worker and a user plays narration
- **THEN** synthesis runs on the GPU backend and produces playable audio.

#### Scenario: Falls back to CPU when GPU is unavailable
- **WHEN** GPU compute is unavailable or its initialization fails
- **THEN** synthesis falls back to CPU, still completes successfully, and produces the same audio without surfacing a narration error.

#### Scenario: Backend chosen once per model
- **WHEN** the execution backend has been selected for a language's model
- **THEN** subsequent sentences in the run reuse that backend without re-probing or repeating a failed initialization.

#### Scenario: High-performance adapter preferred when a choice exists
- **WHEN** the browser exposes both an integrated and a discrete GPU adapter to the worker
- **THEN** the worker requests the high-performance adapter so the discrete GPU is used for synthesis.

#### Scenario: Active compute device shown in the reader
- **WHEN** synthesis resolves to CPU because the browser exposes no GPU adapter, and the user opens the audio control
- **THEN** the reader displays a localized indication that narration is running on the CPU, in place of relying on the browser console notice.

### Requirement: Multi-Threaded Synthesis Enabled on Reader Routes Only

On reader routes, the application SHALL be cross-origin isolated so on-device synthesis can use multi-threaded execution. This isolation SHALL be confined to reader routes and SHALL NOT be applied to the authentication route or other routes, so cross-origin sign-in — which depends on cross-window communication — continues to function. Cross-origin resources the reader legitimately needs (web fonts, document images) SHALL continue to load under the isolation policy.

When cross-origin isolation is active, the synthesis worker SHALL configure the CPU (WASM) execution backend to run across multiple threads, scaling the thread count to the machine's available logical cores (`navigator.hardwareConcurrency`), so that a many-core CPU without a usable GPU is fully utilized for synthesis rather than running on a single thread. The configured thread count SHALL be bounded by the reported hardware concurrency to avoid oversubscription. When cross-origin isolation or multi-threaded execution is unavailable, synthesis SHALL still complete correctly on a single thread; thread configuration SHALL NOT change the produced audio.

#### Scenario: Reader route is cross-origin isolated
- **WHEN** a reader route (`/read/...`) is loaded
- **THEN** the page reports cross-origin isolation, enabling multi-threaded synthesis.

#### Scenario: Sign-in route is not isolated and OAuth still works
- **WHEN** the sign-in route is loaded and the user completes cross-origin sign-in
- **THEN** the page is not cross-origin isolated and sign-in completes successfully.

#### Scenario: Reader cross-origin assets still load
- **WHEN** a reader slice references cross-origin fonts or images
- **THEN** those resources still load and render under the reader's isolation policy.

#### Scenario: Many-core CPU uses multiple synthesis threads
- **WHEN** a reader route is cross-origin isolated on a machine with no usable GPU and multiple logical cores, and a user plays narration
- **THEN** the CPU synthesis backend runs across multiple threads scaled to the available cores rather than on a single thread.

#### Scenario: Single-threaded fallback still completes
- **WHEN** cross-origin isolation or multi-threaded execution is unavailable
- **THEN** synthesis still completes correctly on a single thread and produces the same audio.
