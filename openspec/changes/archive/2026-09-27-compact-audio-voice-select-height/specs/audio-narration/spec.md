## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Free-Tier Voice Selection and Polished Presentation

When the Google Cloud engine is active, the reader audio player SHALL provide a voice selector restricted to Google Cloud Free-Tier voices (Neural2 and WaveNet tiers) for the slice's content language, supporting at least one female and one male voice for Vietnamese (`vi-VN`) and English (`en-US`). Voice selection SHALL NOT be shown when the On-Device engine is active.

The voice selection dropdown trigger SHALL match the compact height, vertical padding, and border radius of the adjacent "Listen" action button (`py-1.5`, ~32px rendered height), ensuring that switching between On-Device and Google Cloud narration engines does not vertically expand or distort the height of the reader audio player bar.

All audio controls, buttons, tooltips, and status indicators SHALL use clean, professional, descriptive copy and SHALL NOT use hype or buzzword labels such as "AI", "AI Audio", or "Google AI". The UI SHALL use standard, subtle iconography (e.g. cloud icon or plain toggle switch) and SHALL NOT use mismatched or aggressive icons such as lightning bolts (`Zap`).

#### Scenario: Voice selector matches Listen button height
- **WHEN** the user switches between On-Device and Google Cloud engine modes in the reader audio player
- **THEN** the voice selector trigger button height matches the height of the "Listen" button (`~32px`), preventing the player bar container from expanding or changing height vertically.

#### Scenario: Free-tier voice selection for Vietnamese slice
- **WHEN** a user views a Vietnamese slice with Google Cloud engine active
- **THEN** the player provides a choice between curated Vietnamese Neural2 female (`vi-VN-Neural2-A`) and male (`vi-VN-Neural2-D`) voices.

#### Scenario: Free-tier voice selection for English slice
- **WHEN** a user views an English slice with Google Cloud engine active
- **THEN** the player provides a choice between curated English Neural2 female (`en-US-Neural2-F`) and male (`en-US-Neural2-D`) voices.

#### Scenario: UI copy and icons avoid buzzwords
- **WHEN** viewing the audio narration player in any state
- **THEN** the controls render clean labels ("Google Cloud", "Thiết bị" / "Device") without "AI" prefixes, and no lightning bolt icons are rendered in the audio control.
