## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Google Identity Services Client Configuration & Fallback
The web frontend application SHALL resolve the Google Identity Services Client ID from runtime configuration using flexible environment variable resolution, supporting either `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.

The system SHALL guarantee that:
1. When either `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set in the hosting environment (including local development runner `.env`), the frontend initializes Google Identity Services (`google.accounts.id.initialize`) with the resolved non-empty Client ID.
2. In local development environments executed via `run-dev.sh`, environment variables from `.env` are automatically propagated to the frontend development server process.
3. If neither variable is configured (empty string), the application SHALL NOT initialize Google Identity Services with an empty Client ID, preventing `400: invalid_request (Missing required parameter: client_id)` authorization errors.

#### Scenario: Local development environment with GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID defined in .env
- **WHEN** a developer starts the development stack with `run-dev.sh` and root `.env` defines `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- **THEN** the Nuxt frontend runtime configuration resolves `googleClientId` to the value of `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- **AND** the Google Sign-In button initializes with the configured Client ID without `client_id` missing parameter errors.

#### Scenario: Production or CI deployment with NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID defined
- **WHEN** the application runs in a container or environment where `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is defined
- **THEN** the Nuxt frontend runtime configuration resolves `googleClientId` to the value of `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.

#### Scenario: Environment without Google OAuth credentials configured
- **WHEN** neither `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` nor `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is defined
- **THEN** the frontend recognizes the missing Client ID, avoids passing an empty string to `google.accounts.id.initialize`, and does not render a broken Google Sign-In authorization flow.
